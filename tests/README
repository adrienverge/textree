This directory contains unit tests for the textree pipeline engine.

Start the tests using the script: ./run-tests.sh


Tests are devided into groups, each in a subdirectory named group.<name>.
For each group, the file group.<name>/pipeline must contain the arguments
to the bin/textree command.

A unit test is made of 2 files:

  group.<name>/<test name>.in
      content which is piped into the textree command

  group.<name>/<test name>.out
      content that is supposed to be output by the pipeline command.
      The contents must be exactly the same, or the test fails.


When a test is failed, a message is printed with the command line of
the unit test (for easy copy/paste), with a diff between the
expected content and the actual content.


.. read the script: ./runTests.sh


Tests can also be useful for learning Textree.
